# 3D Model Haven

This repo contains the website code for [3D Model Haven](https://3dmodelhaven.com/).

I am not a web developer really, so I apologize in advance for the hideous code you are about to see.

Contributions in the form of pull requests, bug reports or simply ideas are welcome.

You will not be able to build the site locally as it requires some database login info,
however it is fairly straightforward PHP for the most part and should be intuitive.
